## Description

Open source documentation for mantatrader.com

Manta-Docs is integrated into our website codebase, as changes are made here, they are automatically reflected on the website. This allows our team to be able to quickly and easily modify the written instructions since Markdown is easy to use, as well as accept outside Pull Requests from users seeking to improve our documentation.
