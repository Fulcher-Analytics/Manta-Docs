# Bot Building

## Introduction

Manta Trader's essential purpose is to allow you to build and create "bots" to trade the markets.
This guide will introduce you to the different types of bots, how to build them, and the interworkings
behind them.

"bot" - a program that buys and sells securities based on certain conditions

To build a bot, go to the Manta Trader Dashboard, and press new Bot. Select Custom Built or Prebuilt,
and follow the instructions below.

#### Bot Types

1. **IFTTT** - IFTTT stands for "If This, Then That". It's a way of building bots that revolves
   around conditional logic. IFTTT bots give you fine control and make bot building easy for beginners.

2. **Indicator Based** - Indicator based bots are bots that buy and sell based on Technical Analysis
   Indicators. Manta offers over 200 technical analysis indicators, including some added ones such as
   Support and Resistance and Sentiment Analysis. Indicator based bots allow you to add infinite amount
   of indicators, and then assign them certain weights. That way, you can fine tune how much each indicator
   contributes to the bots decision.

3. **Fixed Interval** - Fixed interval bots are "dumb". They do not have any conditional logic, they simply
   buy (or sell) on a fixed interval, disregarding the market conditions. Fixed Interval bots allow you to perform
   strategies such as Dollar Cost Averaging. An example of a Fixed Interval Bot would be one that buys 1 share of the
   S&P 500 index every month.

4. **Prebuilt Bots** - Prebuilt bots are custom built bots that are designed by the Manta Trader Team. Prebuilt bots
   typically involve more advanced strategies that can involve things like Artificial Intellegence and advanced statistical
   models.
